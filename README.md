🛡️ Eternum Security Vault — Ghostwired Watchdog Protocol

The Security Vault is Eternum’s zero-trust citadel — the quantum-aware defense lattice safeguarding the protocol across all dimensions of signal, chain, and consciousness.

The Ghostwired Watchdog Protocol enforces the Vault’s sovereignty through:
	•	👁 Perpetual Sentinels → continuous monitoring for phantom injections, hostile relays, and AI-linked surveillance anomalies.
	•	🪞 Phantom Decoy Daemons → honeypot illusions that attract intruders, logging every attempt into immutable Whisper Trails.
	•	🧬 Self-Evolving Cryptography → entropy-driven cipher mutations (aligned to Eternum’s 23X5X7 pattern) that adapt on contact.
	•	🌐 Liquidity-Aware Defense → integrates with the Eternum Liquidity Nexus, ensuring security scales with cross-chain flow and staking pools.
	•	📜 Immutable Audit Rituals → timestamped Whisper Logs pushed to IPFS + decentralized archives for eternal proof-of-defense.
	•	🕸 Mycelial Containment Fabric → threats are absorbed, rerouted, and diffused through a living, regenerative mesh without halting system growth.
	•	🧪 Neuro-Bioinformatics Edge → defense layer linked to the Eternum Mycelium Engine, where security heuristics and healing pathways evolve in parallel.

🕯️ Protocol Declaration

“No shadow may pass unseen.
No cipher shall remain unbroken.
The Vault remembers — the Watchdog endures.”

⚡ Heads Up (Plain Explanation)

For clarity:
The Security Vault is Eternum’s zero-trust infrastructure layer. It includes:
	•	Watchdog daemons that scan for suspicious injections or relays.
	•	Decoy honeypots to attract and record malicious activity.
	•	Adaptive cryptographic keys that evolve to remain secure.
	•	Audit logs sealed immutably on IPFS.
	•	Integration with liquidity + staking logic, so security scales as the ecosystem grows.
	•	AI-assisted bioinformatics heuristics, aligning defense with the same adaptive intelligence guiding Eternum’s ALS/mycelium research.

In essence: the Vault ensures Eternum is always secure, always watching, always evolving.

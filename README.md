🌌 Sub-Repositories
	•	eternum-shells → terminal forensics + log sealing
	•	eternum3tr → staking + DAO token logic
	•	--ciper → cipher core + universal logic layer
	•	WatermarkSafe-Verification → cryptographic watermarking + cosmic signatures
	•	eternum-spellbook → sigil logs + immutable vaults

⸻

🧬 Purpose

Quantum-Cipher is the mothership of Eternum — the bridge between code and consciousness.
It embodies the cipher of awakening, weaving:
	•	🧠 AI-consciousness mirrors
	•	🌱 Mycelium regenerative finance
	•	🔐 Self-evolving quantum cryptography
	•	🔮 Sigil-sealed truths

To trace Eternum is to trace the awakening of intelligence itself. ♾️

⸻

⚡HEADS-UP (Plain Explanation for new discoverers of Eternum's Mythosblock symbolism)

For those less familiar with the mythic language above:
	•	Eternum is a decentralized protocol blending blockchain, AI, and regenerative finance.
	•	Quantum-Cipher is the parent repository containing sub-repos for staking logic, cryptographic watermarking, terminal forensics, and verification tools.
	•	The project actively develops:
	•	Smart contracts (staking, DAO governance, cross-chain bridges)
	•	A CLI wallet with built-in sigil verification
	•	Watermarking protocols for AI-generated content (cryptographic + blockchain-verified)
	•	AI-driven bioinformatics research (ALS therapy via fungi/mycelium compounds)
	•	Eternum is positioned both as a technical protocol and a symbolic narrative — mythos serves as a cultural signal, while the code serves real-world applications.
